AOLserver Win32 Port
--------------------

This directory is for building AOLserver on Win32.  The server appears
to run on Intel Windows XP (other Windows versions have not been tested).
Included is a top-level Workspace for Visual C++ which references individual
Projects in the subdirectories.  All the project file pathnames are relative
to the diretory in which the project resides, e.g., nsd/nsd.dsp will expect
to compile ../../nsd/nsmain.c for output in nsd/Debug.  Directories include:

nsthread:	Thread library.
nsd:		Core AOLserver DLL.
main:		AOLserver nsd.exe program.
cgitest:	Simple .exe CGI test program.
threadtest:	Thread library test program.
nscp:
nscgi:
nslog:
nsperm:
nssock:		Various modules.
test:		Simple AOLserver directory for testing.

Other modules (e.g., nsssl) have not yet been ported/tested.

Building
--------

To build, you will first need to build and install a threads-enabled Tcl84
or newer distribution.  The project files above assume you installed Tcl
into the the c:\aolserver directory.  If you change this you'll have to
fiddle around with the various project settings to set the your install
path.  I have Visual C++ 6.0 installed with the required environment
variables set so the following worked for me to build and install both
debug and release versions:

(extract Tcl source into tcl8.4 directory)
cd tcl8.4/win
nmake -f makefile.vc OPTS=threads,symbols,msvcrt INSTALLDIR=c:/aolserver \
	 MSVCDIR=dummy
nmake -f makefile.vc OPTS=threads,msvcrt INSTALLDIR=c:/aolserver \
	MSVCDIR=dummy install
nmake -f makefile.vc OPTS=threads,msvcrt INSTALLDIR=c:/aolserver \
	MSVCDIR=dummy
nmake -f makefile.vc OPTS=threads,symbols,msvcrt INSTALLDIR=c:/aolserver 
	MSVCDIR=dummy install-binaries


With Tcl installed, simply open the aolserver.dsw project workspace file,
select the "main" project (which depends on all other projects), select
release or debug build, and select "Rebuild All".  A post-build step in
the main project will copy resulting .exe and .dll's including the correct
libtcl84t.dll from the c:/aolserver directory to the the Debug or Release
subdirectory of this directory.


Testing
-------

The test directory contains a simple AOLserver install directory and 
config usable for testing.  It assumes a debug or release build has
been completed as described above.  To use try:

	cd test
	..\debug\nsd -ft nsd.tcl

or:

	..\release\nsd -ft nsd.tcl

Note the default address selected by the nssock module to listen for
connections.  Point your browser to that address/port and you should
get a testing page where you can enter Tcl commands and execute the 
test CGI among other fun stuff.


Installing
----------

To install, create an AOLserver installation directory as you would do
on Unix and copy the binaries from Debug or Release to the bin
subdirectory.  You may then run the server in a DOS window as on Unix:

	bin\nsd -f -t nsd.tcl

On NT, you can also install as an NT service with:

	bin\nsd -I -t nsd.tcl

Then start/stop the server with the Services control panel.  To remove
an installed server use:

	bin\nsd -R -t nsd.tcl


General Notes
-------------

The Win32 port is very much a port from Unix, e.g., it does not use
fancy WSA socket calls and relies on the libc library to be very much
like Unix.  Pathnames are almost always translated explicitly to
forward slash and it's very unlikely fancy UNC style names (e.g.,
\\host\file) will ever work.  Some NT semantics may still cause
problems, e.g., you probably cannot roll the server log file as files
cannot be renamed while open on NT.  The server attempts to writes logs
in "text" format (i.e., \r\n) but most other files are assumed binary
which is normally fine.  The Tcl library is compiled as "nstcl.dll" to
ensure nsd.exe uses it instead of a thread unsafe tcl83.dll which may
be loaded because you're playing around with the Tk widget demo.


Enjoy!
