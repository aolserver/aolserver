<h2>AOLserver Win32 Port</h2>

<br>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
This directory is for building AOLserver on Win32.&nbsp; The server is intended&nbsp;
 to run on Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.x SP6 (and better).&nbsp; While AOLserver
 runs on Windows&nbsp; 9x, the architecture of that operating system precludes
 any serious use. &nbsp; Included is a top-level Workspace for <b>Visual C++
6.x
 or better</b>which&nbsp; references individual Projects in the subdirectories.&nbsp;
 All the
project file&nbsp; pathnames are relative to the diretory in which the
project
 resides, e.g.,&nbsp; nsd/nsd.dsp will expect to compile
../../nsd/nsmain.c for
 output in nsd/Debug.<br>
<br>
Included directories are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>nsthread: Thread library.</li>
  <li>nstcl:&nbsp; Tcl 8.3 modified for nsthreads.</li>
  <li>nsd:&nbsp; Core AOLserver DLL.</li>
  <li>main:&nbsp; AOLserver nsd.exe program.</li>
  <li>cgitest: Simple .exe CGI test program.</li>
  <li>threadtest: Thread library test program.</li>
  <li>nscp: Control port.</li>
  <li>nscgi:&nbsp; CGI interface.</li>
  <li>nslog: Access Logging.</li>
  <li>nsperm: Permissions.</li>
  <li>nssock: Socket Driver.</li>
  <li>nsssl: SSL Socket Driver (requires BSAFE for Win32).</li>
  <li>test:&nbsp; Simple AOLserver directory for testing.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Building</h2>
To build, simply open the aolserver.dsw project workspace file, select
the

 "main" projects (which depends on all other projects), select
release or

 debug build, and select "Rebuild All".&nbsp; Output will be
copied to the Debug

 or Release subdirectory in this directory.&nbsp; The
main project is also setup

 to run AOLserver in the debugger using the
"test" directory above.&nbsp; The

 test directory includes a simple index.adp
which allows you to evaluate

 Tcl commands and has links to execute the
cgitest.exe program and a cgitest.bat

 batch CGI.
<br>
<h2>Installing</h2>
To install, create an AOLserver installation directory as you would do
on

 Unix and copy the binaries from Debug or Release to the bin
subdirectory.&nbsp;

 AOLserver supports both console-mode and service-mode operation.<br>
<br>
You may then run the server in a console window as on Unix:



<pre>bin/nsd.exe -f -t nsd.tcl</pre>
You can also install the server as an NT Service where it is controlled via

 the Services control panel:



<pre>bin/nsd.exe -I -f nsd.tcl</pre>
To remove the server from the list of NT Services, type: 

<pre>bin/nsd -R -f nsd.tcl</pre>
<br>
<h2>General Notes</h2>
The Win32 port is very much a port from Unix, e.g., it does not use
fancy

 WSA socket calls and relies on the libc library to be very much
like Unix.&nbsp;

 Pathnames are almost always translated explicitly to
forward slash and it's

 very unlikely fancy UNC style names (e.g.,
\\host\file) will ever work.&nbsp;

 Some NT semantics may still cause
problems, e.g., you probably cannot roll

 the server log file as files
cannot be renamed while open on NT.&nbsp; The server

 attempts to writes logs
in "test" format (i.e., \r\n) but most other files

 are assumed binary
which is normally fine.&nbsp; The Tcl library is compiled

 as "nstcl.dll" to
ensure nsd.exe uses it instead of a thread unsafe tcl83.dll

 which may
be loaded because you're playing around with the Tk widget demo.<br>
<br>
AOLserver 3.1 and later use the extension ".DLL" for all shared libraries.&nbsp;

 The configuration file automatically determines the extension at server

 startup.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!
