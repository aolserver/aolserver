<h3><a name="Theory_of_Operation"></a>Theory of Operation</h3> The
implementation of the underlying thread interface can have a
noticeable effect on the overal performance of AOLserver.&nbsp; While
AOLserver runs on many platforms, not all platforms perform the same
with the same hardware, e.g., the same Intel hardware provide very
diferent throughput and latency on Linux and FreeBSD.<br>
<br>
A major influence on the overall performance is the scheduling scope
of the thread library.&nbsp; Multithreading scope is often described
as having a "1-1", "1-n", or "n-m" model.&nbsp; 1-1 means each thread
is scheduled by the kernel along with all other threads.&nbsp; 1-n
means one kernel thread is actually used by all process threads and
thread context switching occurs in a user-level library.&nbsp; n-m
means some number of kernel threads share the load of some larger
number of process threads.&nbsp; The nature of the AOLserver workload
(e.g., many simultaneous, I/O and system call bound threads) has shown
that the 1-1 model generally works best.&nbsp; 1-n often does not
provide enough concurrency and n-m introduces library overhead.&nbsp;
In general the OS vendors go to great lengths to make sure the kernel
scheduling algorithms perform very well under a variety of
circumstance whereas library implementations are generally more
simplistic in design, forced to share resources with many non-threaded
processes, or require careful wrapping of many system calls with
non-blocking I/O and signal handling.&nbsp; Heavily-loaded sites may
realize better performance a change in configuration, e.g., upgrading
to HP/11 from HP/10 or running SGI sproc-based nsd instead of the
pthread-based nsd.<br>
<br>
However, this does not mean that 1-n or n-m platforms should be
avoided or you should not run AOLserver unless your platform is 1-1.
In general, if you experience reasonable performance you do not need
to worry about the performance of the underlying thread library.&nbsp;
In fact, there are cases where the 1-n or n-m model may outperform,
e.g., code which is somewhat compute bound and subject to lock
contention.  The reason is a 1-n or n-m platform can switch threads
when it encounters a held lock and continue to make progress whereas a
1-1 thread must have the kernel put the thread on a lower level wait
queue, generally a more expensive operation.&nbsp; Another example is
a large-scale hosting environment where many customers share a single
machine.&nbsp; You may find better scalability with 1-n threads than
1-1 on the same hardware as each low-traffic customer would require a
single Unix process instead of six or more for base operation.<br>
<br>
Listed below are the available and currently used threading models on
each platform AOLserver runs on:&nbsp; <br>

<pre>
Platform:	Available:	Used:	Notes:

Solaris,	1-1, n-m	1-1	1-1 appears to perform better.
UnixWare

Linux		1-1		1-1	clone()-based LinuxThreads.

SGI pthread	n-m		n-m	1-1 currently cannot be enabled.

SGI sproc	1-1		1-1	sproc-based custom interface often
					provides better performance then
					pthread-interface.

HP/10		1-n		1-n	Performs poorly under load.

HP/11		1-1		1-1	n-m currently cannot be enabled.

FreeBSD		1-n		1-n	rfork()-based 1-1 interface may be
					available shortly.

Apple OS/X	?		?	Likely 1-1.

DEC Unix 4.0	1-1, n-m	n-m	1-1 can be enabled but blows up
					after many thread creates/exits.
					n-m model performs well.

Windows NT	1-1		1-1	New Fiber() Win32 API may provide
					n-m in the future.

<h3><a name="Known_Issues"></a>Known Issues</h3> We really want to
make libnsthread.a into libnsthread.so and take it out of nsd.&nbsp;
This has already happened for Win32, so it should be a relatively
simple matter for Unix.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Sample_Configuration"></a>Sample Configuration</h3> The
library itself has no "configuration" but AOLserver has configuration
parameters that affect the thread library.&nbsp; Please refer to the
<a href="../doc/config.txt">Configuration File Reference</a>for
extensive threading parameters for AOLserver.<br> <pre></pre>
