<h3><a name="Theory_of_Operation"></a>Theory of Operation</h3>
This driver is used to interact with external database drivers.&nbsp; These are
 usually called "database proxy daemons".<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Known_Issues"></a>Known Issues</h3>
The driver API talks over sockets to remote daemons in an inefficient manner.&nbsp;
 It is highly recommended that the proxy daemon and AOLserver both run on
 the same machine.&nbsp; Of course, the database can still run on a remote machine
 -- it's only the connection between AOLserver and the proxy daemon that
 is inefficient and that inefficiency is greatly alleviated by running on
 the same host.<br>
