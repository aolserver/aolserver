<h2>Bugs Fixed</h2>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<blockquote>

Modules nsunix, nsvhr, and nssolid are untested.

<p>

The optional "fancy" ADP parser has problems parsing certain
constructs.
  
<p>
The nsperm module has not been fully tested for thread-safety.

<p>
The database interface, while stable, is due for a redesign post-3.0.

<h2>Building and Installation</h2>

<blockquote>

AOLserver 3 has an entirely new build process that requires gmake and
a C compiler (preferrably gcc). On nearly all systems, you need only
extract the source distribution from either a tar file or CVS.  The
file include/Makefile.global contains platform-specific information if
you run into trouble.  Type the following to make the server:

<br>
<tt>gmake</tt>
<p>

<p>
Once AOLserver builds, install it.  If you had trouble, look at
include/Makefile.global and the top-level Makefile

<br>
<tt>gmake install PREFIX=/usr/local/aolserver</tt>
<p>

To smoke-test your AOLserver build, change to the installation
directory and type:

<br>
<tt>./bin/nsd -kt nsd.tcl</tt>
<p>

The sample configuration listens on port 8000 at your machine's
primary internet address.  Like all Unix servers, AOLserver must start
up as "root" to use the privileged ports 80 and 443.  In normal
operation AOLserver changes itself into a normal Unix user. You
specify the username to use with the "-u" option as illustrated below.

<p>

To install a production AOLserver, edit the nsd.tcl to suit your
needs.  The sample nsd.tcl is very complete and there is a copious
reference in doc/config.txt. Then add this line to your /etc/inittab:

<br>
<tt>
as:2345:respawn:/usr/local/aolserver/bin/nsd -it /usr/local/aolserver/nsd.tcl -u user -g group
</tt>

<p>
If your *BSD Unix system does not have an /etc/inittab, you can use
this line for your /etc/rc.local (or whatever) startup script:

<br>
<tt>

while /bin/true
<br>
do /usr/local/aolserver/bin/nsd -it /usr/local/aolserver/nsd.tcl -u user -g group
<br>
done

</tt>
<p>

Windows users may start AOLserver as an NT Service or from a Win32
console window just like in Unix. For development and testing, we
recommend using console mode. For production, we very highly recommend
running AOLserver from the NT Services control panel. To install
AOLserver as an NT Service, type the following:

<br>
<tt>
bin/nsd -I -f nsd.tcl
</tt>

<p>

To remove AOLserver from the NT Services control panel, type this instead:

<br>
<tt>
bin/nsd -R -f nsd.tcl
</tt>

<h2>Directory Structure</h2>

<blockquote>

The AOLserver directory structure is designed to help keep a complex
system organized in a straightforward, modular fashion.  There is a
shared and a private Tcl library, as well as a shared and private
module directories. Tcl code and global data not specific to a web
server go into <tt>modules/tcl/tclmodulename/</tt> and
<tt>modules/modulename/</tt> directories, respectively.  Data files
written by a server application should go into the
<tt>servers/server1/modules/modulename/</tt> directory.

<p>

<blockquote>

<h3>What Goes Where</h3>

<blockquote>

<pre>
Server executables:     bin/
Server logs:            log/
Shared read-only data:  modules/modulename/ 
Tcl library:            modules/tcl/modulename/
Page root:              servers/server1/pages/
Private module data:    servers/server1/modules/modulename/

Other directories:
Access logs:            servers/server1/modules/nslog/
Access Control records: servers/server1/modules/nsperm/
SSL cert/key storage:   servers/server1/modules/nsssl

</pre>

<h2>AOLserver Modules</h2>

<blockquote>

AOLserver comes with several modules but only the most-used modules
are included in the binary distribution. To build the modules, edit
the top-level Makefile and edit the "MODULES" line before you run
gmake. Alternatively, you can change into the module's directory and
type "gmake". In nearly all directories you can type the following to
build and install the module you need:
<br>
<tt>
gmake PREFIX=/your/install/path
</tt>

<p>

The standard modules are:

<blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>nssock</dt>

<dd>Services HTTP connections.</dd>

<dt>nscgi</dt>

<dd>Enables CGI scripting.</dd>

<dt>nscp</dt>

<dd>Provides remote-administration functions via a tclsh control
port.</dd>

<dt>nslog</dt>

<dd>Common log format module for access logging</dd>

<dt>nsperm</dt>

<dd>Permissions module for site-wide access control.</dd>

<dt>nsext</dt>

<dd>External database driver for databases like Sybase and Oracle.</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>

The optional modules are:

<blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>nsssl</dt>

<dd>This module lives in the nssock directory and is built with
<tt>gmake SSL=1</tt>.  It enables SSL connections to AOLserver. A
binary build of nsssl with export-level security comes with the
AOLserver binary distribution.  To build this module, you need BSAFE
from <a
href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/">http://www.rsasecurity.com/</a>.</dd>

<dt>nsunix</dt>

<dd>A communications driver that uses Unix domain sockets.</dd>

<dt>nsvhr</dt>

<dd>A virtual-hosting redirector that lets you use multiple
independent web servers on one IP address communicating via a Unix
domain socket or regular TCP/IP socket.</dd>

<dt>nspostgres</dt>

<dd>The Postgres database driver. Requires Postgres from <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</a></dd>

<dt>nssybpd</dt>

<dd>The Sybase database driver. Requires the Sybase Client Libraries
from <a href="http://www.sybase.com/">http://www.sybase.com/</a>.</dd>

<dt>nssolid</dt>

<dd>The SOLID database driver. Requires the SOLID database server
which is available at <a
href="http://www.solidtech.com/">http://www.solidtech.com/</a>.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<blockquote>

AOLserver documentation is available in the doc/ directory of the
source distribution as well as online at <a
href="http://aolserver.com/doc/">http://aolserver.com/doc/</a>.

<p>

Incrementally, the documentation will be brought up-to-date with the
latest version of AOLserver 3. Many documents have been added to the
documentation from the AOLserver archives. We also appreciate
corrections and additional documentation from you. Source code changes
are now in the ChangeLog file in the top-level directory, either
manually editted or automatically entered using the Emacs "C-x 4 a"
key sequence.

</blockquote>

<h2>Online Resources</h2>

<blockquote>

AOLserver has an active development community at <a
href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a> where you may
register with the development system, subscribe to mailing lists,
explore even more contributed software, and get help with
AOLserver. Please visit <a
href="http://aolserver.com/community/">http://aolserver.com/community/</a>
and keep up with us!

</blockquote>

<h2>Your Feedback</h2>

<blockquote>

We welcome your feedback and bug reports in The AOLserver Community at
<a
href="http://aolserver.com/community/">http://aolserver.com/community/</a>. We
do not accept bug reports or feedback regarding AOLserver 2.x -- you
must be using AOLserver 3.x or better.
