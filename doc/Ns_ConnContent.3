.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide access to the content sent with a request.
.PP
\fBNs_ConnContent\fR returns a pointer to the content in memory.
The result of \fBNs_ConnContent\fR is not guarenteed to be
null-terminated.  Safe code should be careful to use the
result of \fBNs_ConnContentLength\fR to avoid overrun.
.PP
\fBNs_ConnContentFd\fR returns an file descriptor to an open temporary
file which contains the content.
.PP
\fBNs_ConnContentLength\fR returns the length of the memory buffer
and/or the size of the open temp file.  Any trailing \\r\\n sent
beyond the content from most browsers on a POST is not included.
.PP
\fBNs_ConnContentOnDisk\fR returns 1 if the content is currently on
disk, such that a call to Ns_ConnContentFd will not cause a new file
to be created.  When it returns 0, a call to Ns_ConnContent will not require
a mmap() call.
.SH "CONTENT PRE-READ"
.PP
While receiving the request before connection processing, the server
will pre-read the entire content body and either copy the content
to memory or spool it to an open file depending on virtual server
config settings.  Requests with content beyond the \fImaxcontent\fR
virtual server setting are rejected, requests with content between
\fImaxinput\fR and \fImaxcontent\fR are spooled to a temp file, and
small requests (the majority of simple POST's) are copied to memory.
There is no need for a request processing extension to consider
possible delays in reading content from the client as all content
is available before connection processing begins.  The rationale
for this approach is that the driver thread can efficiently multiplex
reading content for serveral request, tolerating any network delays.
Legacy direct content reading routines, e.g., \fBNs_ConnRead\fR,
are now emulated on top of the \fBNs_ConnContent\fR.
.SH "RESOURCE MANAGEMENT"
.PP
\fBNs_ConnContentFd\fR returns an open file descriptor allocated
by a call \fBNs_GetTemp\fR and must not be closed as it is owned
by the server core and will be closed at the end of the connection.
In addition, there is no filename for the open file as the file is
removed when opened for security reasons and to ensure garbage
collection.  In practice, the open file should be used to verify,
parse, and copy content elsewhere as required.  Access at the Tcl
level is also available via the \fBns_conn contentchannel\fR option.
.PP
On a call to \fBNs_ConnContent\fR, either the existing memory buffer
will be returned or the temp file will be memory mapped on the first
call.  This will require temporary virtual memory to support the
mapping until the end of the connection.  Likewise, on the first
call to \fBNs_ConnContentFd\fR, if a temp file does not already
exists one will be allocated and the memory content will be spooled
to the file.  These semantics allow one to access the content in
either mode, assuming resources are available, regardless of the
original location of the content.

.SH "DESIGN NOTES AND LARGE CONTENT CONSIDERATIONS"
.PP
The design goal of the server is to support the ordinary case of
reasonably small content requests (i.e., POST forms and small file
uploads) in a convienent way without limiting a custom app to support
very large requests.  In particular, a call to \fBNs_ConnGetQuery\fR
for a \fImultipart/file-upload\fR POST will result in an implicit
call to \fBNs_ConnContent\fR to parse the fields.  This could require
significant temporary virtual memory plus dynamic memory to copy
non-file fields into the resulting \fINs_Set\fR. See the \fIns_limits\fR
command to control maximum resource requirements.
.PP
For custom apps, an extension could work with the underlying open
file via \fBNs_ConnContentFd\fR or \fBns_connn contentchannel\fR
to avoid large virtual memory requirements subject to disk space
availability.  To avoid inadvertant memory mapping of a large upload
by other extensions calling \fBNs_ConnGetQuery\fR, consider using
a HTTP method other than \fIGET\fR or \fIPOST\fR required by
\fBNs_ConnGetQuery\fR, e.g., \fIPUT\fR.
