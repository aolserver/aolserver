.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Critical section locks are used to prevent more than one thread from
executing a specific section of code at one time. They are implemented
as "objects", which simply means that memory is allocated to hold the
lock state. They can also be called "sychronization objects".
.PP
While a thread is executing a critical section of code, all other
threads that want to execute that same section of code must wait until
the lock surrounding that critical section has been released.
.PP
This is crucial to prevent race conditions which could put the server
into an unknown state. For example, if a section of code frees a
pointer and then decrements a counter that stores how many pointers
exist, it is possible that the counter value and the actual number of
pointers may be different. If another section of the server relies on
this counter and reads it when the pointer has been freed, but the
counter has not yet been decremented, it could crash the server or put
it into an unknown state.
.PP
Critical section locks should be used sparingly as they will adversely
impact the performance of the server or module. They essentially cause
the section of code they enclose into behaving in a single-threaded
manner. If a critical section executes slowly or blocks, other threads
that must execute that section of code will begin to block as well
until the critical section lock is released.
.PP
You will normally want to wrap sections of code that are used to both
read and write values, create and destroy pointers and structures or
otherwise look at or modify data in the system. Use the same named
lock for both read and write operations on the same data.
.PP
Threads that are waiting for a critical section lock to be released do
not have to poll the lock. The critical section lock functions use
thread condition functions to signal when a lock is released.
.TP
\fBNs_CsDestroy\fR(\fINs_Cs *csPtr\fR)

Destroy a critical section object.  Note that you would almost never
need to call this function as synchronization objects are typically
created at startup and exist until the server exits.

The underlying objects in the critical section are destroyed and the
critical section memory returned to the heap.
.TP
\fBNs_CsEnter\fR(\fINs_Cs *csPtr\fR)

Lock a critical section object, initializing it first if needed. The
thread may wait on the critical section condition variable if the
critical section is already owned by another thread.
.TP
\fBNs_CsInit\fR(\fINs_Cs *csPtr\fR)

Initialize a critical section object. Memory will be allocated to hold
the object's state.

.TP
\fBNs_CsLeave\fR(\fINs_Cs *csPtr\fR)

Unlock a critical section once. A count of threads waiting to enter
the critical section is kept, and a condition is signaled if this is
the final unlock of the critical section so that other threads may
enter the critical section.
