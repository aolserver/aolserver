.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These routines are used to generate complete responses, including
headers, approriate status codes, content types, and possibly short
HTML content messages for the most common HTTP error or status
responses.  They each coorespond to a particular HTTP status code,
for example, \fBNs_ConnReturnNotFound\fR generates an HTTP 404 "Not
Found" response.  They all return NS_OK if the response was sent
or NS_ERROR if an underlying routine failed.

.PP
The server can be configured to intercept calls to these
routines and internally redirect to another local url.
This can be used to generate a more meaningful message,
perhaps in a language other than the internally compiled
English strings, or to generate a valid HTTP 200 response
with alternate content.  See the man page on \fBNs_RegisterReturn\fR
for details.

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnBadRequest\fR(\fIconn, msg\fR)
Returns an HTTP 400 response with the short HTML message "Invalid
Request: The HTTP request presented by your browser is invalid."
The optional \fImsg\fR string, if present, is also included in the
message body.

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnForbidden\fR(\fIconn\fR)
Returns an HTTP 403 response with the short HTML message "Forbidden:
The requested URL cannot be accessed by this server."

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnInternalError\fR(\fIconn\fR)
Returns an HTTP 500 response with the short HTML message "Server
Error: The requested URL cannot be accessed due to a system error
on this server."

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnNoResponse\fR(\fIconn\fR)
Equivalent to \fBNs_ConnReturnStatus\fR(\fIconn, 204\fR).

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnNotFound\fR(\fIconn\fR)
Returns an HTTP 404 response with the short HTML message "Not Found:
The requested URL was not found on this server."

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnNotImplemented\fR(\fIconn\fR)
Returns an HTTP 404 response with the short HTML message "Not
Implemented: The requested URL or method is not implemented by this
server."

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnNotModified\fR(\fIconn\fR)
Equivalent to \fBNs_ConnReturnStatus\fR(\fIconn, 304\fR).

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnOk\fR(\fIconn\fR)
Equivalent to \fBNs_ConnReturnStatus\fR(\fIconn, 200\fR).

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnStatus\fR(\fIconn, status\fR)
Generates a response with the given HTTP \fIstatus\fR with no
content.

.TP
int \fBNs_ConnReturnUnauthorized\fR(\fIconn\fR)
Returns an HTTP 401 response with the short HTML message "Access
Denied: The requested URL cannot be accessed because a valid username
and password are required."  A "WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\fIserver
realm\fR" header is also included in the response.
