<h3><a name="Theory_of_Operation"></a>Theory of Operation</h3>
The nscp module provides remote administration through a simple tclsh-like

 interface.&nbsp; The user connects to the control port, logs in with a username

 and a password, and types Tcl commands as if he was in any other tclsh.&nbsp;

 All Tcl commands available to ADPs and Tcl scripts in AOLserver are available

 with this interface.&nbsp; It is also a very valuable monitoring and debugging

 tool.&nbsp; The interface to the Tcl interpreter is extremely simple and only

 supports limited telnet control codes and does no terminal emulation.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Known_Issues"></a>Known Issues</h3>
Although you can type "CTRL-C" and exit the control port, if you started

 any Tcl commands that run forever they will continue running for the live

 of the server session.&nbsp; This can be useful if you need to run a long index

 process and want to log out right away.<br>
<br>
The default installation echos the password to the screen.&nbsp; If you want to

 suppress the password, set "<tt>ns_param echopassword true</tt>" in the

 config file.&nbsp; This option does not work on all platforms which is why it

 is disabled by default.&nbsp; The password should not be very sensitive since

 you need to connect via localhost to reach the control port on the default

 installation, anyway.<br>
<br>
While nscp can listen on any interface, we recommend that you nscp listens

 on localhost (127.0.0.1) so that users who attempt to use the control port

 are already authenticated Unix users.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Sample_Configuration"></a>Sample Configuration</h3>
The sample-config.tcl file has logic to set the control port username and

 password at the top of the file.&nbsp; The default username is "nsadmin" and

 the password is "x".&nbsp; This is disabled by default but you can re-enable

 it by uncommenting the line.<br>
<br>
To create a password, telnet to the control port with "nsadmin" and "x" and

 then type "<tt>ns_crypt password salt"</tt>.&nbsp; The gibberish that is returned

 goes into the "nscp_user" variable.<br>
<pre># nscp: Uncomment the sample password and log in with "nsadmin", password "x", 
#       type "ns_crypt newpassword salt" and put the encrypted string below.
